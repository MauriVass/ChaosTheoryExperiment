# ChaosTheoryExperiment
This is the proof that we are inside a computer simulation!!.  <br/> Just kidding. <br/><br/>
This experiment shows how chaos and randomness can bring to order. <br/>
The experiment consists of: a shape with n vertices that could be a triangle, square, etc.; a starting point (say A) randomly chosen inside or outside the figure; 
then at each iteration one of these vertices is randomly chosen and the point A is moved halfway in the direction of the chosen vertex; iterate again and at some point 
some kind of unexpected figure will appear! <br/><br/>
Wait.. Are we in a computer simulation?
