# Chaos Theory Experiment
This is the proof that we are inside a computer simulation!!.  
Just kidding.  

## Experiment
This experiment shows how chaos and randomness can bring order.  

The experiment consists of: 
- a shape with n vertices that could be a triangle, square, etc.;
- a starting point (say A) randomly chosen inside or outside the figure;
- then at each iteration, one of these n vertices is randomly chosen and point A is moved halfway in the direction of the chosen vertex;
- iterate again and at some point **some kind of unexpected figure will appear!**  

Wait... we are not in a computer simulation, aren't we??  

## Features
- [x] User Interface
- [x] Customizable simulation speed
- [x] Different possible polygons: triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon and octagon
- [x] Possibility to change the length of each polygon
